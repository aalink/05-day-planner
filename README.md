# 05-day-planner

Link to deployed application: https://aalink.github.io/05-day-planner/

This project's goal is to create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It makes use of jQuery in addition to [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to work with dates and time.

Challenges
```
Although the popularity of jQuery and Moment.js has reduced over the years, it's still important for web developers to familiarize themselves with the features and benefits of each API.  This is because there are companies that still make use of them in their code. The challenge I experienced with this project was relatively simple, that is to say, it's a matter of becoming accustomed to the realization that jQuery is providing a different way of doing some of the same things can JavaScript can already do.  For example, to query or create an element, a web developer needs to make use of documentation to find the required code that provides the same functionality as traditional JavaScript.  Moment.js also provided the same challenge of having to make use of documentation.

What I Learned
```
Memorizing every single feature of an API is unrealistic, so this project was in large part an exercise of learning how to find the answer using the resources that are made available to developers as they are building their applications.  While there is significant value in having a deep understanding of plain JavaScript, it isn't a requirement in order to effectively use an API that can compliment the code you have already written.


```
Conclusion
```
This project is a foreshadowing of what will likely become standard practice in future projects.  Frameworks and APIs are widely available to the community for a reason.  They are meant to be used because it makes more sense to utilize tools that can simplify the creation of projects. It also saves time that could otherwise be spent to implement functionality that is unique to each project.  If a solution has already been engineered, it makes little sense to recreate something that has been tested and proven to work.
